# 🚁 Drone Stabilization AI  

This project is a **physics-based simulation** where a drone learns to **stabilize itself** using **reinforcement learning**. It employs an **Actor-Critic neural network** to make real-time stabilization decisions, adapting to dynamic conditions through trial and error.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Reinforcement Learning** – Uses an Actor-Critic neural network for continuous control.  
- **Physics Simulation** – Realistic drone motion with forces and torque calculations.  
- **Self-Learning** – The AI improves stabilization over time via reward-based feedback.  
- **Interactive Visualization** – Built with **Pygame** for real-time simulation display.  

## 🏃‍♂️ Running The Simulation

```sh
python train.py
```

## 🛠 Technologies  
- **Python** – Core language for simulation and AI training.
- **Pygame** – For visualization and interaction.
- **PyTorch** – Neural network implementation for reinforcement learning.
